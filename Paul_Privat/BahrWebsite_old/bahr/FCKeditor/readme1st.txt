Three steps to quick - install FCKeditor4CMSimple

1. Unzip the archive to a local folder and keep the folder structure
2. Make a backup of your files at the server, if you have an older version, 
   then upload the files to your webserver:
   /cmsimple/fckeditor.php -> goes to CMSimple-folder (same folder as cms.php)
   /FCKeditor/*.* -> goes to the root of your CMSimple installation (same folder as index.php)

   your folderstructure should now be like the following:
    
    .index.php
    |--2lang
    |--cmsimple
    |-----fckeditor.php
    |--content
    |--downloads
    |--FCKeditor
    |--images
    |--plugins
    |--templates


3. Login to CMSimple -> Settings -> Edit configuration -> set the value for editor_external
   to "fckeditor" and save your settings

Enjoy!

****

Note: 
On some servers the filebrowser will not work if there is an index.xxx -file in the 
resource folders (from version 2.4.0 by default ./downloads and ./images).
These files are thought to prevent directory listing of this folders which is turned 
off by many servers. Anyway these files are present in the downloads of the CMSimple package.
If the filebrowser returns an empty window without links to your files,
try to solve the problem by deleting these index.xxx files.


If you run into trouble:
Please check the detailed PDF-Manual which is available at http://www.webdeerns.de:
fckeditor_integration_in_CMSimple.pdf
