*** Version 2.4.0
Update by Holger Irmler, 2009-09-01

-Changed the default folder-structure:
 all files, except images, are going to /downloads (without subfolders) to be compatible with the CMSimple-filemanagement.
 For update-installations - up to version 2.3.0 - there are predefined configurationsettings to use the old folder-structure
 (look at the end of the file /FCKeditor/editor/filemanager/connectors/php/config.php)
-Some cosmetic chages are made on the filemanager

-Added a new filebrowser, initial written by Martin Damken as an imagebrowser, with 
 a lot of new features like deleting of files, preview of image files and so on.
-All internal links and resource-paths are now saved relative to CMSimple - root folder
 so you can move your installation to another folder without replacing paths in the content file
-The default CMSimple folders are used from now:
 /images
 /downloads       -> the link-dialog returns ?&download=file.ext      (use "Protocol: other" and ressource-type "Downloads" in the Link-dialog)
 /downloads       -> the link dialog returns <a href= file.ext> links (use "Protocol: other" and ressource-type "File" in the Link-dialog)
 /downloads/flash
 /downloads/media
 Note: with ressource type "Downloads" it's impossible to create sub-folders and cretae links from subfolders upon compatibility with CMSimples download-function.
-A little "Save changes?" message appears on exit without saved content
-Toolbar "CMSimple" enhanced. Old versuion is available as "CMSimpleOld"
-SWFObject-Plugin for valid flash integration added
 Note: Only with the flash dialog, not with the "FLV /MP3 Player Plugin"!
 (libraries are google hosted. If you want the files on your own server 
 follow the description in the readme at the SWFObject - plugin folder
-The QuickUpload was removed from the dialogs, please use the new filebrowser
-The default filebrowser was left in the package as a zip-file
